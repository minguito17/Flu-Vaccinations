# 📊 Visualizing Vaccination Behaviors — Predicting Influenza Vaccinations

## 📌 Project Overview

**Pharma Analytics and Insights, Inc.**, in collaboration with the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, aims to develop predictive models to understand vaccination behaviors and forecast influenza vaccine uptake (H1N1 and seasonal flu). This supports strategic decisions for vaccine manufacturing and distribution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict whether an individual will receive the H1N1 or seasonal flu vaccine.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize vaccine supply chains.
- Enable the CDC to plan public health interventions effectively.

---

## ✅ Business Value

- **Resource Optimization:** Accurate demand predictions help reduce waste and ensure adequate supply.
- **Policy Guidance:** Data-driven insights inform evidence-based policy and tailored public health messaging.
- **Preparedness:** Better pandemic response through informed vaccine stockpiling.

## 🗂️ Data

- **Source:** 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey.
- **Focus Variables:**  
  - `h1n1_concern`  
  - `doctor_recc_h1n1`  
  - `opinion_h1n1_vacc_effective`  
  - Demographics (age, gender, location)
- **Key Visuals:**  
  - Univariate histograms  
  - Bivariate scatterplots  
  - Correlation matrices

## ⚙️ Solution Approach

1. **Data Review:** Assess data quality, integrity, and distribution.
2. **EDA & Feature Selection:** Explore data visually; identify key predictors.
3. **Modeling:** Build logistic regression models; evaluate with metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall (sensitivity)
   - AUC-ROC
4. **Validation & Deployment:** Refine models and prepare for production use.

---

## 📏 Evaluation KPIs

- **Confusion Matrix:** Track true/false positives/negatives for each vaccine.
- **Recall:** Measure sensitivity to actual vaccination behavior.
- **Project KPIs:** On-time delivery, minimal schedule changes.

---

## 📌 Assumptions & Constraints

- **Data Ethics:** Compliance with HIPAA; apply Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs).
- **Time:** Strict adherence to project timeline.
- **Data Quality:** Address potential quality issues with thorough cleaning.
- **Software/Hardware:** Use robust infrastructure for large-scale data handling.

---

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 3: Data preparation & feature engineering.
2. Develop & fine-tune predictive models.
3. Deploy models & monitor performance.
4. Generate targeted recommendations for CDC and manufacturers.
