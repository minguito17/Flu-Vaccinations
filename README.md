# Predicting the 2024 US Presidential Election

## Description / Overview

This project uses historical US presidential election data to model and predict the likely outcome of the 2024 presidential election. By analyzing voting patterns from 1976 to 2020, the team built models to classify state-by-state results and visualize electoral vote projections.
